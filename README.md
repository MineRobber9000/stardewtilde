A farm game. Will be able to be played with multiple users on the same computer.

## Idea ##

From IRC chat on tilde.town:

>18:15 < minerobber> i kinda want to make a game for the town where you can plant crops and sell/trade them  
>18:15 < minerobber> money would be used to buy seeds and land

## Credits ##

- [mio from tilde.town](//tilde.town/~mio) for the name
